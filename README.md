SCADA redesign and implementation for Hydrogen &amp; Oxygen plant using Siemens WinCC
# SCADA Design for Hydrogen & Oxygen Plant (Siemens WinCC)

## Overview
This project documents the redesign and implementation of a SCADA system
for a Hydrogen and Oxygen production plant at International Steels Limited (ISL).

The objective was to overhaul an existing SCADA system, correct design and
logic issues, and deliver a more realistic, operator-friendly, and maintainable
system tailored to production requirements.

> ⚠️ Note: Due to industrial confidentiality, source PLC programs and WinCC
project files are not included. This repository serves as a technical portfolio
and system documentation.

## Project Duration
- December 2022 – February 2024

---

## System Architecture
- PLC Platform: Siemens S7-300
- SCADA: Siemens WinCC
- Engineering Tool: SIMATIC STEP 7

---

## Scope of Work

### 1. Data Collection
- Digital Inputs (DI)
- Digital Outputs (DO)
- Analog Inputs (AI)
- Analog Outputs (AO)
- Alarms
- Trends

### 2. SCADA Frame Design
The plant consists of two main frames:
- Frame 1: Production & Purification
- Frame 2: Extended operations and system finalization

Each frame included:
- Realistic process graphics
- Proper tag mapping
- Alarm visualization
- Trend visualization
- Parameter configuration pages

### 3. Tag Management
- Complete tag mapping between PLC and WinCC
- Logical grouping of DI, DO, AI, AO
- Tag assignment to respective screens

### 4. Testing
- All pages tested on live PLC system
- Verification of alarms, trends, and operator actions
- End-to-end validation with production team
