# SCADA Screens Design

The SCADA system was structured into multiple functional screens
to support plant operation, monitoring, and diagnostics.

## Main Screen Categories
- Production overview
- Purification process
- Alarm pages
- Trend pages
- Parameter and settings pages

## Design Considerations
- Realistic graphical representation of process equipment
- Clear status indication (running, stopped, alarm)
- Easy navigation between screens
- Minimal operator confusion during abnormal situations

## Operator Interaction
- Start/stop controls where applicable
- Alarm acknowledgment
- Parameter monitoring and adjustment
