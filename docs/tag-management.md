# Tag Management Strategy

A structured tag management approach was used to ensure
maintainability and clarity within the WinCC project.

## Tag Categories
- DI (Digital Inputs): Status signals, limit switches, interlocks
- DO (Digital Outputs): Valves, motors, actuators
- AI (Analog Inputs): Pressure, temperature, flow measurements
- AO (Analog Outputs): Control signals

## Tag Assignment
- Tags mapped directly from PLC addresses
- Logical naming conventions applied
- Tags assigned to corresponding SCADA screens
- Tags linked to alarms and trends where required

## Benefits
- Easier troubleshooting
- Faster commissioning
- Improved long-term maintenance
